# Kenya Domestic Supply Agricultural Predictions
- The aim was to try and predict Kenya's agricultural domestic supply for both crop and animal products, which I took to be the domestic consumption
- The prediction was to help see in what direction Kenya's consumption is headed with regards to the total amount(tonnes)
- This result(s) might help compare with the production in the subsequent years and estimate whether production will cater for the consumption.
- The datasets/csv files were obtained from the [FAO(Food Agricultural Organisation)](www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home)
- I selected only those datasets based on Africa
- You can select the number of years you want to predict and the country whose data you want to see ,but only those from Africa

### Sources of Errors
- There are many factors that may contribute to domestic supply/consumption either external or internal:
  * Change in traditions which affect consumption(what people were consuming in 1990 is not same to now
  * Other countries supply/demand of certain products will affect the quantitity we can export or import
  * Political policies/allegiances, friendship ties
  
- I predicted a final result from data I had predicted(to fill the values) hence this might have amplified the error



### Any recomendations on what/how to improve the model are highly appreciated
